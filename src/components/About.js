                <h2>Morning Coffee</h2>

                <p>Morning Coffee is Designed (by you) to help kick start your day. 
                    Catching up on all your apps to get a grasp on the day is stressful.
                    We get it! Instead design a page that has everything you need to know over a cup of coffee!
                    Doesnâ€™t that sound nice?</p>
